# Machine Requirements

For this challenge to run, you'll have to have Docker running or have PHP running locally on your machine.

This README assumes you're using Docker to run the challenge. 

1. Start the Docker containers; `docker compose up -d`

2. Run your tests; `docker compose exec app vendor/bin/phpunit .` 

3. Stop the docker containers; `docker compose down`

Without further ado - good luck with the challenge and, even more importantly, HAVE FUN!
